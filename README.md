# AssignRef

Assign Ref is a web application that was created to serve as a personnel management website for sports
organizations and the officials within them. This tool empowered officials to effortlessly oversee game-day
coverages, schedules, statistics, meetings, and an array of other essential tasks. 

During this project I worked on creating a form in react that the owner could create a zoom meeting from and then email the link to employees in the company. To do this I created a controller and service file in .Net that authenticated the user with Zoom's API to create the meeting. Within React the user is able to search for individuals by using a SQL stored procedure and accessing the companies database.
